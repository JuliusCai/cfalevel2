1. ANOVA计算
R-square, F, 相关系数,SEE
2. beta reversion; adjusted R-square; adjusted beta
3. heteroskedasticity; serial correlation; multicollinearity
BP x-2 test,DW test,
Type 1, type 1& type 2, type 2 error

autocorrelation 自己推导standard error, 1/根号T

4. covariance stationary 假设：constant and finite EV/VAR in all periods,/covariance with itself for a fixed number of periods in the past or future in all periods
5. random walk, unit root test(dickey-fuller test), cointegration
6. incompleteness error, invalidity error, inaccuracy error, inconsistent error, non-uniformity error, duplicate error
normalization is the process of rescaling/data wrangling, standardization
data preparation(cleansing), data wrangling(preprocessing)
wrangling for structured data: transformation, scaling
transformation include extraction, aggregation, filtration, selection, conversion(type)

feature engineering: a process of creating new features by changing or transforming existing features

feature selection methods:
frequency measutres can be used to remove noise features
chi-square test can be applied to test the independence of two events
mutual information measures can relate the token to correseponding text class

roc curve plot false positive rate against true positive rate for various cutoff points
FP type 1 error, FN type 2 error
F1 score: the harmonic mean of precisoin and recall


example: A上下均为6，B上4，下1
